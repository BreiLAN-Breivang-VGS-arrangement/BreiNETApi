# BreiNETApi

BreiNETApi is home to all the API's that are used in order to keep both our ticketing system and our tournaments page functional. Each of the three folders are their own separate scripts and need to be run together in order to work. As an example of this, the authentication API is responsible for authenticating a user when a request is given to the other API's that needs higher clearance.
